## 4.1 Overview


The Project window is used to create and manipulate Opencontour projects using various elements, such as panels, bars, windows, etc. After finalizing the **Project Settings**, the new project will be created. The project's name and version number are displayed in the upper right-hand corner of the **Project Window**.

![Image](/image/proejct_window_dashboard.jpg)

In the project window, you can access the following menus:

- Dropdown Menu
- Main Menu
- Drawing Window
- Utility Menu
- Layer Menu
- View Settings
- Message bar

**Dropdown Menu:** A Dropdown Menu is located below the browser address bar. This menu is used to save and open ﬁles, conﬁgure display parameters, access design features and 3D tools.  There are also links to access the Help Guide directly. Refer to section [Dropdown Menu](#dropdown-menu) for more details.

**Main Menu:** When a project is opened, the green Main Menu button appear at the top of the display window. A project can be built using the layer drawing and editing tools available in this menu and running functions.

**Drawing Window:** When a project is open, the Drawing Window is the central area of the display window and the location of the CAD design work. When a project is opened, this section is initially empty until layers are added.

**Utility Menu:** The Utility Menu enables users to make changes to **Project Settings**, **Project Properties**, **Scheduling**, **Scripts**, **Charts**,**Reports**,**Leach Model** and **Stacking**. These topics are described throughout this document in the order in which they occur procedurally.

**Layer Menu:** The Layer Menu is used to edit individual layers.

**Message bar:** The message bar is used to convey information such as coordinates, elevations, strike angles, wall angles, and distances to the user.

**View Settings:** The View Settings portion is used to control what and how much information is displayed in the Drawing Window.  Other uses include how contour projections are made.

**Additional View Option:**

- **Zoom in:** Click the green **+** button to zoom in. This has the same effect as turning the mouse wheel.

- **Zoom out:** Click the green **-** button to zoom out. This has the same effect as turning the mouse wheel.

- Hide/Unhide 


**Copy**

Features may be copied from an active layer to inactive layer. To copy from an active layer to an inactive layer, follow the steps mentioned below.

1.	Activate the layer you wish to copy a feature from. To activate a layer, simply click on the layer writing in the Layer Menu.

2.	Use the **Choose Feature** or **Select Features with a Box** button, to select the item. The selected item will change to a light green color.

3.	Right-click the mouse and select a layer from the dropdown. The layers listed will contain all available layers in the current project. The selected item will be copied to the selected layer, at the same elevation as in the originating layer. 

4. 	Verify that the copy procedure worked properly by unchecking the originating layer of the feature and turning on and activating the destination layer.

    **NOTE:**

    - **If a layer (for example, Filler5) does not appear, you must first add the Filler layer.**
    - **Only Cutter and Filler layers can be copied.**



An active layer's features may be removed. Use the **Choose Feature** or **Select Features with a Box** button to select a feature, then right-click. A **Remove** option will appear in the Drawing Window.

The available options are:

<hr>

### 4.2.3 Display

The display menu is used to summarize specific views and data information.

  ![Image](/image/Display.jpg)


##### Display > Volumetric 

The data represents a summary of the attributes of the features in the CutterResult layer. The Volumetric feature provides two options for filtering:

- Detail
- Summary By 

  ![Image](/image/Detail_summaryby.jpg)



**Detail View **

1. Click **Display > Volumetric > Detail**. The Volumetric Summary window appears.

  ![Image](/image/Volumetric_summary.jpg)  

&nbsp;
2. The properties for each CutterResult shape are explained in the following table. The table values can be sorted by pressing the header, e.g. (pn, Phase Name).  This sorts the pn entries in the entire table so they are listed alphanumerically. An arrow will appear beside the sorted header.  Repressing the header will sort them in the opposite direction.  The table data can be copied and pasted directly into Excel, or the entire table can be saved in CSV format using the Export button.  Exporting will create a comma delimited file that may be viewed in Excel, or a similar program.  

  ![Image](/image/Details_table.jpg) 


**Summary By**

These summaries are used to query pit volumes, design dumps, and construct leach pads applied to any shapes that are present in the CutterResult layer. The mass data is independent of the Mineplan

The **Summary By** provides three options to filter:

- Filler/Cutter#

- Phase Name 

- Bench 

**Filler/Cutter#**: This option summarizes the cut and fill areas, volumes, and mass and generates a file with a calculation for each cut fill number.

  ![Image](/image/Volumeteric summary_1.jpg) 


**Phase Name**: This option functions similarly to the **Filler/Cutter#** option, except that each line of data will include the Phase Name (pn). The similarities between cut_ﬁll_num and pn can be noticed in the detail report.

  ![Image](/image/Volumeteric summary_2.jpg) 


**Bench**: The Bench option makes use of elevation (z), but does not provide information about the initial cut_ﬁll_num or pn.

  ![Image](/image/Volumeteric summary_3.jpg) 


##### Display > Contour By PM

This function can be used to populate the BaseResult layer with period map contours after a schedule is run.

1. Click **Display > Contour By PM**. The Contour By Period Mined window appears.

    ![Image](/image/ContourByPM.jpg) 

Enter a period number (for example: 5) or a date in the **Period Mined (pm)** entry box. The single down arrow displays a calendar.

Fillers can obstruct Cutters if they are positioned on top of each other.  Hence, there is a choice for their display.  This is apparent in pits where backfilling practices are used.

When the Filler and Cutter layers' checkboxes are checked, this function creates contours in the BaseResult layer for them.


##### Display > Gridline Settings

Grid settings are used to include grids in the project Drawing Window display.

1. To select the grid interval, click the **Display > Gridline Settings**. 

  ![Image](/image/Grid_settngs.jpg)

**Scale Bar** 

If the Scale Bar is enabled, it will be displayed in the Drawing Window's lower left corner. The value displayed in the bar and the spacing between the gridlines are adjusted by zooming in and out with the mouse.

  ![Image](/image/grid_settings_scale_bar.jpg) 


**Compass** 

If the compass is shown, it will appear in the upper right corner of the Drawing Window.  The arrow vertices towards the North.

  ![Image](/image/grid_settings_compass.jpg) 


**Labels**

Northing and Easting intervals are displayed by ticking the Labels box in **Display/Grid** Settings

  ![Image](/image/grid_settings_label.jpg) 


##### Display > 3D

The Drawing Window's layers are displayed three-dimensionally in a new browser tab. Click **Display > 3D**. 


The 3D view options are:

- **Contour Lines** – for viewing the contours as 3D strings. It has the capability of showing the layers in a Spin mode, with a variable Speed bar.  

-	**Surface** – displays the contours as an opaque overlay.

- **New Surface** – displays the contours of each selected surface as an opaque overlay with property shading options.

- **New Timeline** – animation of the project for the project life with property shading options.

-	**Cross Section** – shows a sliced view from a selected vantage point. It allows the user to change the view section in a popup menu option.

####  4.4.1 Project Settings 


Each project listed in Opencontour has its own set of Project Settings parameters, initially saved in the setting up of a New Project. These parameters can be exported and imported as required..

The project settings can be accessed by clicking the Project Settings button in the Utility Menu.

The project window is divided into three distinct settings windows.

- [Drawing Window Settings](#drawing-window-settings)

- [Schedule Settings](#schedule-settings)

- [buildMineplan Settings](#buildMineplan-settings)


It is important to click the **Save** button after making any changes in this window. These settings are stored in an online database and can be viewed from any computer connected to the internet. 

  ![Image](/image/Figure 6 2 Project Settings Window.jpg)


##### Drawing Window Settings

The Drawing Window Settings section controls what is visible and design parameters in the Drawing Window.

##### Schedule Settings

The Schedule Settings portion helps to deﬁne swell and densities.  These are used in the volumetric tonnage calculations for Cutters and Fillers.  The density value units entered should be in either ton/ft3 or t/m3.  Filler tonnages will include swell.

The **Constraint** variable and the **Routing** variable are defined here.  The Constraint variable can be the property tons (data.tns) or truck calendar hours (data.trch).  It is the Mineplan block property that is referenced as the quantity to be scheduled.  This is the **Mine Constraint** value entered for each period in the in the Schedule window.  

The **Routing** variable is used to determine if material is ore (>0) or waste (0).  This value controls where that block will be sent after mining.  Waste is sent directly to defined dumps, while ore is processed or stockpiled for beneficiation processes.


##### buildMineplan Settings. 


The buildMineplan Settings portion of the window is used to set site-speciﬁc Model values to be written to the Mineplan for open pit projects. 

The **Density (dens)** entry is used to map the density Property when building the Mineplan.  This entry can be data.dens, a number, or an expression.

It is necessary to have a routing variable **ow property (ow)**, data.ow in the Mineplan layer.  This value designates whether a block is ore or waste (greater than zero designates ore) and can determine downstream processing routes.


##### Auto Save (in minutes)


When the checkbox is selected, the interval will produce a backup of the All (Model) group ﬁle, e.g.  “April 11, 2019-09.41.00AM pit1 all backup.json”. 

<hr>

#### 4.4.2 Project Properties 


To open the Project Properties screen, click Project Properties button in the Utility Menu.

 ![Image](/image/Figure 6 3 Project Properties Window.jpg)


The properties window is divided into three distinct tabs:

- Populate Properties 

- Spreadsheet

- Legend


##### Populate Properties

The Populate Properties section at the top of this window is used to add a property to the selected layer. Properties can be added by typing the name of the property in the Property ﬁeld in the Layer Properties dialog box.

Typically, the Mineplan characteristics are modified. The shown list will contain all of the project's layers.

To add a property to a **layer**:

1. Select the layer from the **Choose Layer** dropdown option.

##### Spreadsheet

The data of a chosen layer can be viewed in the Spreadsheet tab.  The information can be copied and pasted directly or can be exported as a CSV using the **Export CSV** button.  Changes can also be made and saved in the displayed table.


#####	Legend

The Legend tab enables viewing a property in the Drawing Window shaded by color.  One legend, with six property options is available.  There is only one Legend Name available per project. Individual rows may not be imported into an existing legend, nor exported.  Imported and exported legends should encompass the entire legend for the project.

A previously exported legend can be imported and can be deleted pressing the **Delete** button.  The Legend is saved in the Config layer for the project; with a Group file save.  This layer also contains any saved Charts and the inputs from the Grid tab.

The Legend is accessible using the Project Properties button from the Utility Menu, which opens the Project Properties screen with the Legend portion.

To create a legend, follow these steps:

  1. Press the **Project Properties** button.
      - A previously saved legend may be imported using the **Choose File** button.
  2.	Type in the property of interest to be shaded in the **Property** column, e.g. au.  The property entry must match the property case and syntax as contained in the Mineplan or Model layer.
  3.	In the **Project Properties** window, enter in the numerical bins and shading colors in the same row.
  4.	Press the **Save Legend** button to save this to the Project.  
      - To save the legend for use in another project, tick the **Export** checkbox.  You will be prompted to save the Legend with the filename “legend.json”.  The saved Legend will appear in the dropdown list of saved legends for the project.

<hr>

#### 4.4.4 Create Script 

To open the Script window, click the **Create Script** button in the Utility Menu.  

Scripts are useful for adding or editing properties for a chosen layer.  The expressions are written in JavaScript and that involve calculations of other properties and/or numbers and can be time dependent.  

- Scripts are used to add predefined properties to the Mineplan used in Quick Charts and Reports.

- Scripts can be written to run over the Mineplan before, during or after running a 
schedule.

- A variable used in a script must either already exist in the layer on which it is working or be deﬁned in the script's previous line. 

<hr>

#### 4.4.5 Create Charts 

To open the charts window, click **Create Charts** button in the Utility Menu. The Mineplan layer is the primary source of data for the charts, after the Schedule has been executed.  These are discussed in the Scheduling section 

  ![Image](/image/Figure 6 8 Upper Create Charts Window.jpg)

<hr>

####	4.4.6 Report Tool

To open the report window, click **Report Tool** button in the Utility Menu.

When executing a report, diﬀerent browsers may display diﬀerent export prompts to capture the data. Reports are generated over the Mineplan layer by specifying a grouping parameter, for example, pm (period mined).

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:grey">

## 4.5 Layer Menu

To activate a layer, simply press on the layer writing in the Layer Menu.  The layer will expand with a bold orange border.  The properties of this layer can be viewed and edited while the layer is active.  

When a file is loaded into a project, the originating file name for each layer will appear beside the layer, if the layer contains data. 

  - The number of files added to a layer will also display in brackets.  The (2) is the count of the number of files added to the layer shown for the Cutter layer below.  

      ![Image](/image/layer_Menu.jpg)

  - Cutter and Filler layers will display the Phase Name (pn) given to the layer after the **Cut Contours with Cutter/Filler** function has been performed.    

  - The darkness of the Drawing Window display of a layer is editable using the blue horizontal scroll bar immediately below the layer name in the Layer Menu.  

  - When inserting features at an elevation displayed in the Drawing Window, all features will be assigned that elevation until the elevation is changed.   

  - The order of the layers listed in the Layer Menu can be changed by dragging each layer to the desired location.  The position of each will not be recalled on reopening the project.

  - All Contours of an active layer can be displayed using the keyboard shortcut key, a, or pressing the radio button for All Contours radio button in View Settings.  These can be continually displayed in an overlay for the Base and BaseResult layers when changing between elevations (pressing either **q** or **w**) by ticking the Legend box in the Legend portion of the View Settings menu.   

  - There are three QuickButtons at the top of the Layer Menu, All/No layers (![Image](/image/Three_quick_button.jpg) ), **Schedule** and **Drawing**. These are used to efficiently turn the display of multiple layers on and off in a project.  After a QuickButton is pressed, any layers in the Layer Menu can be turned on or off.  The layers displayed by each button are shown in the table below.  


  ![Image](/image/Table 7 1 Layer Menu QuickButtons.jpg)
<hr>


### 4.5.1 Layer Geometry Types

Each defined layer has a unique geometry type:

  ![Image](/image/Table 7 3 Layer Geometry Types.jpg)



### 4.5.2 Layers

#### Base Layer


The Base layer includes the surface topography before any shapes are cut or filled in the project.  

Base layer features and internal shadings are red. The current elevation causes that contour to change to a solid feature with editable vertices.

  ![Image](/image/Figure 7 5 Base layer Red Coloring.jpg)


#### Geotech Layer

Geotech layer features are blue, with grey internal shading.  These features do not change appearance with elevation changes.

The Geotech layer options in the Layer Menu are displayed figure below.  The dropdown option in allows the user to select the geotechnical domain display of the entered Name or IRA_BFA information entered in the Geotech layer domain.

Domain addition is described in Part 2.


  ![Image](/image/Figure 7 8 Layer Options, Geotech Layer.jpg)

  ![Image](/image/Figure 7 9 Geotech Layer, Name Option.jpg)

  ![Image](/image/Figure 7 10 Geotech Layer, IRA_BFA Option.jpg)

#### Cutter Layer

Viewing Cutter layer contours at the current elevation causes the contour to change to a solid feature with editable vertices and internal shading if there is data on the elevation in the Cutter layer.   

Each cutter layer has a default coloring, although the colors can be selected using the Cutter Color option.

The Cutter layer number is incrementally assigned as Cutters and Fillers are added, recorded by the property **cut_fill_num**.  

The Cutter layer options in the Layer Menu are displayed figure below.  The Phase Name (pn) can be entered for each Cutter layer, such as phase1, pit2, etc.  Underneath the Phase Name (pn) entry area in Figure below is the Direction (dir) property entry.  The Phase Name (pn) is written to the layer and is available for Label display on pressing Cut Contour with Cutter/Filler.  


When projecting the Cutter contours to benches above and below, the Geotech or Project Settings’ **Cutter InterRampAngle (IRA)** and **Cutter Bench Face Angle (BFA)** are used.  The type will be written as ‘cut’.

  ![Image](/image/Figure 7 12 Layer Options, Cutter Layer.jpg)

  ![Image](/image/Figure 7 14 Drawing Window Cutter Layer Properties After Cut Contours With CutterFiller.jpg)


#### Filler Layer

Filler layers are used for constructing dumps and leach pads.  When drawing the Filler, the Project Settings’ **Filler InterRampAngle (IRA)** and **Filler Bench Face Angle (BFA)** are used, as set in the Project Settings.  As with Cutters, the current elevation causes that contour to display as editable vertices.  

The Filler layer options in the Layer Menu are displayed figure below and are similar to the Cutter options.  The **cut_fil_num** is automatically assigned.  Each Filler layer has a default coloring, although the colors can be selected.  

Underneath the Phase Name (**pn**) entry area is the stack Direction (**dir**) property entry.  This is used to specify a filling direction from 0-360 degrees (90 degrees represents East).  The **min_ow** and max_ow properties in Figure 7 15 are used to determine the ow property(**ow**) values accepted in that Filler.  For example, if the Filler is not designed to accept ow property (**ow**) values of 3 in a project where the maximum ow property (**ow**) value is 3, the min_ow can be 0 and max_ow property 2.  The max_ow property default it set to 10000.  The entries accepted only include numbers.

The Filler layer Properties are editable in the Drawing Window.  After pressing the button **Cut Contour with Cutter/Filler** the properties are written to the layer.  The Filler layer will be a ‘Fill’ type record using the Filler material density and swell, specified in the Schedule Settings portion of the Project Settings window or in the Layer Menu.  

DXF files can also be imported and saved into Filler layers. 

![Image](/image/Figure 7 16 Drawing Window Filler Layer Properties Before Cut Contours With Cutter-Filler.jpg)

![Image](/image/Figure 7 17 Drawing Window Filler Layer Properties After Cut Contours With Cutter-Filler.jpg)



#### BaseResult Layer

These features display orange, with lighter orange internal shading.  The BaseResult layer shows the project surface contours after the pit has been cut (mined), and/or waste dump and leach pads have been filled.  The BaseResult layer becomes populated by using the **Cut Contour with Cutter/Filler** operation for those layers ticked on in the Layer Menu and is overwritten each time the function is run.  

The Dropdown Menu’s **Display > Contour** By PM function is used to create period maps or the BaseResult layer for a given period of mining.  

 ![Image](/image/Drawing Window ButterResult Layer Properties.jpg)

 ![Image](/image/Figure 7 18 BaseResult Layer Coloring.jpg)



#### CutterResult Layer

CutterResult layer features are lime colored and shaded at the current contour. The CutterResult layer is the result cut and filled shapes representing the material cut (phases mined) or filled (waste and ore material dumped/stacked).  This layer also populates by using the **Cut Contour with Cutter/Filler** operation for those layers ticked on in the Layer Menu and is also overwritten each time the function is run.  

The cut and filled volumes are used in the Dropdown Menu’s **Display>Volumetric** function options.

 ![Image](/image/Figure 7 25 Drawing Window CutterResult Layer Properties For A Filler Type Contour.jpg)


#### Mineplan Layer

The Mineplan layer is used to store a subset of the block model data that exists within the CutterResult layer shapes for projects with pits.  This layer is populated using the **Create Schedule > Build function**.  For leach stacking projects, the Mineplan layer will initially contain an ore type (ow), period mined (pm), ore tonnages (otns) and grades.


Other properties can also be added/edited in the by pressing the Project Properties button in the Main Menu.  The **Legend** can be used to display colored blocks based on their grade.

More details for the Mineplan layer are included in the Schedule instruction.


 ![Image](/image/Mineplan layer grades and legend color.jpg)


#### Schedule Layer

This layer includes all the features required for the Schedule (truck and loader fleets, processing, stockpiles, leach pads, dumps, haulage route intersections, etc).  Each schedule feature added may be dragged to its desired location by utilizing the **Drag Features** button from the Main Menu.  

When inserting features at an elevation displayed in the Drawing Window, all features will be assigned that elevation.  This can be changed using the z: property in the Properties window.  

More details are included in the Schedule instruction.

#### Model Layer

The model layer can be used to store the geological block model for a project with pits.  This layer does not contain drawings.  It is used up to the **Create Schedule > Build** function process, where a subset of the model volume within the pit is built and stored in the Mineplan layer.  Once the Mineplan has been constructed, the Model is rarely used for an open pit project.  The **Legend** and **Labels** can be used to display colored blocks based on their grade.

  1. To open a Model file, select the Dropdown Menu’s File/Open Model function. 
  2.	Select the location of the model JSON file.  A progress indicator will be displayed while the Model is loading.  The loaded model filename will be displayed in the Layer Menu beside Model layer. 
  3.	Once a model file has been added to the project it’s parameters can be displayed using **Legend** and **Labels** at each elevation.  
  4.	Press the **q** or **w** keys to refresh the screen.  
  5.	Move to an elevation of interest and left mouse click once on one of the numbers displayed in the Drawing Window to view what other information is available on that block.  To view the full display pan outside the display window.


  The Model layer is also used to store the grid for leach stacking projects.  The grid discretizes the CutterResult layer into uniform blocks that can be scheduled.  

  More information on grids stored the Model layer for stacking projects is in the Stacking documentation.

  ![Image](/image/Model Layer Properties – Leach Panel Stacking Project.jpg)

  ![Image](/image/model_layer_property.jpg)

  ![Image](/image/model_layer_result.jpg)


#### Solution Layer

Leach stacking projects will include a Solution layer, added by choosing the **Add Layer>Add Solution Layer** from the Main Menu.  This layer represents the functionality in turning solution on (on) and off (off) for selected polygon shapes.  These shapes can be built using the **Add Polygon Features** button to contain the centroids of CutterResult panels on any elevation of the CutterResult layer.  

The drawn polygon and its properties will be visible at below elevations coinciding with the CutterResult layer.  The Solution layer will populate the CutterResult and Mineplan layer’s on/off properties as a number for records inside the Solution layer polygon and CutterResult shape.  

  ![Image](/image/Solution Layer.jpg)


#### Roads Layer

Roads layer features are blue as shown in figure below. They turn bold red when the road segment has a scheduling error (i.e. grade is >15%), or after activating the All Contours function (pressing a). The segment information is also displayed activating the All Contours function.

More details for the Roads layer are included in the Schedule instruction.

 ![Image](/image/road Layer.jpg)

![Image](/image/Detail Displayed On Pressing The a Key.jpg)


#### Import Layer

The Import layer can be used when importing CAD type files, such as updated topographies and as-build surfaces.  This layer can be used to draw or correct what is stored in the other layers in the Layer Menu that contain contours, geotechnical information, Cutters, Fillers and Roads.
